    0.5.7
        * anonymine.py, anonymine_engine.py:  Removed the no flag count option.
        *: Minor clean ups every here and there.
        * anonymine.py (main): $(prefix)/etc is a weird place to expect to find
            configuration files.  They wouldn't be there unless you've run
            ./configure && make && make install on a system where such a
            directory exists.  Not needed as a backup search path.
        * anonymine.py, anonymine_engine.py:  Settings for highscores are now
            mandatory.

2019-03-09      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.5.6
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine):
            Bugfix: Fails to initialize fields in non-unix
                mode.  It was supposed to work without fork (although slowly),
                but apparently it never has.
            Bugfix: Removed tempfile without closing first.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Add a curses_voodoo attribute to decide
            whether or not to reset to shell mode while initializing. It's
            needed on at least Debian, but makes the game break on Windows.
        * anonymine.py: Cleaned up the imports section.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_display): Use more if less fails.
        * cursescfg, anonymine.py (curses_game.input): ^C and keypad
            enter did not work in curses mode on Windows. Also added a quit
            key "q".
        * windows-beta/*, anonymine.py [Windows]: New location for configuration
            files and such.
        * INSTALL.Windows.txt: (created)
        * README (platforms): It was time for an update on that section.
        * FAQ: Using Cygwin does not seem so convenient anymore.

2018-11-07      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.5.5
        * anonymine_engine.py: Use SIGTERM instead of SIGCONT to kill workers.
        * anonymine.py: Ignore SIGTSTP due to curses issues.
            BUG: The above change was specifically made to allow pausing.
        * configure.py: Workaround for PyPy on OpenBSD, there are no
            site-packages nor dist-packages directory in sys.path.
        * desktop/icon.icns.py: Removed some silliness.
        * mkdist: Remove existing tarballs to avoid complaints from gzip and xz

2018-10-10      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.5.4
        *: Some systems do not have a symlink for `python`. Fix to allow
            python3 and python2 as alternatives.
        * INSTALL, INSTALL.Haiku: Minor modifications

2018-10-07      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.5.3
        *: Moved from Github to Gitlab
        * configure.py: Issues with install(1) again.
        * mkenginecfg: Workaround for OpenBSD's sysctl.

    0.5.1
        * anonymine.py (user_input):
            - Removed outdated comment
            - Don't bother checking if doc-hex or doc-square exists in
              cursescfg.
        * anonymine.py (convert_param):
            - Corrected the easter egg code.
        * anonymine.py (arg_input, user_input):
            - Mentioned the issue with high densities

2017-02-20      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.5.0
        *: Updated the year on a few copyright statements.
        * INSTALL, configure.py: No need for the -w option anymore.
            (Something must have broken its use by now. ;)

2017-01-02      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.17
        * anonymine.py (curses_game (print_cell)): Don't restrict the
            attention mode on numbers surrounded by too many flags. If
            at most one flag must be left before finding misplaced flags,
            2000 mines would be nearly impossible to sweep.
        * NEWS: (See above change in anonymine.py)
        * anonymine.py (line 3): s/2016/2016-2017/

2017-01-01      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

    0.4.15
        * ChangeLog: Hide mail address.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Created new method `print_cell` to
            reduce code duplication and introduce the attention mode to
            numbers with too many flags around them.

2016-12-28      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.14
        * anonymine.py (curses_game (print_char)), cursescfg:  Allow non ASCII
            textics on Python3.

            been a non flagging and non revealing mouse events.
        * README: New account play@anonymine-demo.oskog97.com:2222
        * cursescfg:
            - The `pair` index of the tuples has since long been removed.
            - Advice users to scroll at the edges when using the mouse.
            - BUTTON1 and BUTTON3 comment
            - Unicode support comments.
            - Extra wide characters are not supported

2016-12-25      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.13
        * anonymine_fields.py (generic_field.reveal): Use a loop instead of
          recursion. Allows really low mine densities.

    0.4.12
        * RELEASE-NOTES: Added some old notes.

            "/usr/local/liby-5.4/site-packages"
    0.4.11
        * anonymine.py (curses_game), cursescfg: Mouse support.

    0.4.9
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.play_game): "time taken to play"
            was calculated after the "Press the any key" screen.

            - Reverse video for mines

2016-12-19      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.8
        * configure.py, Makefile.static, INSTALL: Don't install modules
            for the other Python version. Removed $(MODULES_OTHERVER).
        * Makefile.static (build-freedesktop, build-macosx): Use Makefile as
            a Makefile.
        * Makefile.static (all etc), mk-symlinks: New file mk-symlinks that
            creates $(builddir)symlinks which creates the symlinks using a

            - $(MAIN_STAGE) now depends on Makefile.vars too.
            - $(ENGINECFG_STAGE) now depends on Makefile.vars.
        * RELEASE-NOTES: Inform that 0.4.5 and 0.4.6 didn't fix issues
            #16 and #17 properly.

2016-12-16      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.6

                reconfigure: Run ./configure with the same arguments
                Makefile.vars: Avoid running an unchanged ./configure again
            - Sort the order of Makefile variables.
        * INSTALL: srcdir and builddir should only bet sent to `./configure`.

2016-12-10      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.4.3
        * anonymine_solver.py: The PyPy bug has been tracked down to the
            `possibilities` function.   Bug fixed: used `is` instead of `==`
            when comparing a variable against a string literal.
        * test.py: Use `profile` instead of `cProfile`.

        * anonymine_solver.py (solver_loop): Found a potential bug:
            `fail` was not set to False if a solvable cell was found.
        * anonymine_solver.py: Removed commented out profiling code.
        * anonymine_solver.py: (WRONG>>) Tracked down the PyPy bug to the
            number_neighbours function.  Uncomment the print and
            run pypybug() in test.py. (<<WRONG)

2016-12-05      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

        * INSTALL: Many small changes.
        * NEWS: Added NEWS for 0.4.  Will bump the version to 0.4.0 if there's
            nothing else to do on 0.3.z.

    0.3.12
        * configure.py: Use `sys.exit` instead of `os._exit` as the latter
            caused weird issues with stream redirection.

    0.3.11
        * README: http://anonymine-demo.oskog97.com:8080/ link removed.

    0.3.9
        * Forgotten Windows stuff, minor style fixes.

            distinguishable on monochrome terminals.

2016-08-16      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

        * INSTALL: Warn of the removal of configuration files.
    0.2.32
        * anonymine.py (highscores_display), cursescfg: Use pseudo-tab-ish
            spacing between the columns and make horizontal scrolling in less
            faster.

        * configure.py [openindiana]: INSTALL_CMD was changed to INSTALL in
            Makefile.static at version 0.1.17.  I forgot to change it in
            configure.py as well.
        * INSTALL: Added "INSTALL" as a recognized variable
        * anonymine_engine.py [Minix]: Guess what, Python 2.7 on Minix 3.3
            has no math module. Created a really dumb replacement.
        * anonymine.py [Minix]: Can't import subprocess either. Piping to
            less will fail, but that's a tolerable error.
    0.2.29
        * INSTALL: Windows notice removed. Added less(1) as a weak dependency.
        * `make dist`: Include "testcfg" as it's needed by something in

    0.2.28
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (_load)): Bugfix:
            The IO error table didn't work as hiscores was None rather than []
        * (All python modules): Allow running as root on Haiku.
        *: New file INSTALL.Haiku.
        *: Moved Windows.txt to INSTALL.Windows to match the new pattern.

2016-08-11      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.27
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations): Fixed syntax error.
        * Makefile.static (release): Added verbose messages, added new
            target "test" as a synonym for "check".
    0.2.26
        * anonymine.py (highscores_display):
            - Add -# 1 as options to less.
            - Allow subprocess to fail.
        * README: Added some notes about the tested platforms.
            Minix 3 and openindiana no longer work.
        * mkenginecfg:
            - seq(1) is apparently a GNU specific utility.
            - Added quotes around $nproc to let the Python script succeed
              even if no method of counting processors worked.

2016-08-10      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

2016-08-08      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.23
        *: New file: HACKING, RELEASE-NOTES
        * README: Moved file listing to HACKING.
        * Makefile.static: $$ doesn't work on FreeBSD's make, it needs to be
            $$$$ which doesn't work on gmake.
            - Created a small shellscript to be invoked from `make dist`.
            - Hard coded the icons sizes. Ugh.
        * Makefile.static ($(MAIN_STAGE)): Depend on Makefile.static to
            force the correct version number.
        * Makefile.static (dist): Don't depend on zip and tarballs. Doing
            that will cause issues with parallel make.
        * Makefile.static, configure.py, RELEASE-NOTES, INSTALL: Changed the
            values for freedesktop, macosx and windows to the unambiguous true
            or false.

2016-07-19      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.22
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (display)): Www HH:MM goes back to
            six days; Added "(Future)"
        * configure.py, Makefile.static, anonymine.py, INSTALL: Allow
            $(sysconfdir) to be anything.
        * INSTALL: Modified.

2016-07-18      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.21
        * Makefile.static, anonymine.py, configure: Moved version numbering
            into Makefile.static only to simplify version bumping.
    0.2.20
        * cursescfg:  Difficult to see anything in B&W mode: Change '?' to '.'
            to increase the visual difference between flags and free cells.
        * INSTALL: Updated to match these changes:
        * Makefile.static: Disabled overwrite-cfg due to the new behavior
            of check-install-cfg.
        * install-cfg:
            - Wrote docstrings
            - Changed return values for `decide`
            - Tell which configuration file is incompatible and refer to the
              source file.
        * install-cfg, Configuration files: Added support for a status quo
            marker line.  If the magic line can be found in the destination
            file, it will be overwritten.
        * install-cfg, Makefile.static (check-install-cfg): Send the verbose
            variable to ./install-cfg to make it shut up if it has nothing
            exceptional to say.

2016-07-17      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.19
        * cursescfg: Hexagonal grid was still too bright -> set to A_DIM,
            text does not need to be bright.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_add_entry): Fixed double-prompt for nickname.
    0.2.18
        * anonymine.py, BUGS: Got away with only redrawing on the first click
            (initialization).  This was previously a potential performance
            issue.
        * cursescfg: Bright/bold magenta was too bright for the hexagonal grid.
    0.2.17
        * BUGS, anonymine.py: #9, use a different fix.
            - `ask` modified to handle EINTR
            - New function `output` created as wrapper.
            - Added 'str' as paramtype to `convert_param`
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.init_field2):
            - Handle EINTR on os.wait, os.fork already does this
              unintentionally.
            - raise security_alert rather than Exception for the timeout alarm.
              (except Exception caught lots of other stuff.)
        * anonymine.py: Use str(game_engine.security_alert) rather than
            game_engine.security_alert.message.
        * BUGS: Added note about #3
        * mkenginecfg, enginecfg.default: sec-maxtime: 90 -> 900

2016-07-16      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.16
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores), etc: Force UTF-8 on the file.
            - Functions may return unicode objects as strings on Python 2, but
              that's no problem as unicode and str can be combined as long as
              the str only contains bytes in the ASCII range.
            - add_entry, will decode the str object on Python 2 using
              locale.getprefferedencoding() as encoding
            - The maxsize key now refers to the number of bytes on both
              Pythons.
            - Added a nick-maxlen key to limit the length of nicknames.
        * anonymine.py (highscores_add_entry): sys.stdin.readline may raise
            UnicodeDecodeError on Python 3. Grr.
        * anonymine_engine.py (init_field2): open(file, 'x') raised ValueError
            on Python 3.2, **try** 'wx' and then 'x', and if both fail, 'w'.
        * mkenginecfg, enginecfg.default: entries set to 16, previously: 10

2016-07-15      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.15
        * Makefile.static (print-destinations): \t doesn't work on FreeBSD;
            indented manually with normal whitespace instead.
    0.2.14
        * Makefile.static: Undo change in 0.2.9 causing configuration files
            to not be installed in clean environments:
            - install-dirs now installs CFG_DIR and $(DESTDIR)$(vargamesdir)
            Apparently, install
    0.2.13
        * configure.py: BUGFIX in many find_ functions:
            Don't use Makefile[var] for checking the existence of directories,
            use expand(var, Makefile) instead.  Detected on FreeBSD where
            $(prefix)/var both exists and doesn't.
    0.2.12
        * INSTALL:
            - Tidying.
            - Wrote a section on srcdir, builddir and DESTDIR.

            - Tidied
            - Removed #0
        * configure.py:  Wrote missing doc-strings.
        * configure.py:  Moved default Makefile variables from getargs to main.
    0.2.10
        * anonymine_engine.py (init_field2):
            - Use SIGTERM to kill children if SIGCONT is unavailable.
            - Allow fork() to fail.
            - Use signal.alarm() in a more elegant way.
            - Add 64 bits of entropy to the tempfiles, just in case
              open(file, 'wx') fails to do its trick.

2016-07-14      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>

        * mkenginecfg: time and pprint modules are no longer needed.
        * mkenginecfg: Write out the configuration file manually.
    0.2.7
        * anonymine_engine.py anonymine.py: Python 3 fixes:
            - anonymine_engine.hiscores.display.format_deltatime formatted
              the ms part as gibberish. [Fixed]
            - anonymine.play_game, anonymine.highscores_add_entry did not
              flush. [Fixed]
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores (display)): "/\T" -> "/\T time"
    0.2.6
        * anonymine.py: New functions highscores_display and
            highscores_add_entry.  Highscores are now displayed

    0.2.5
        * anonymine_engine.py (hiscores.add_entry): Reload the hiscores file

            now take two arguments: title, prompt
        * anonymine.py: Input callback updated.

2016-07-13      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.3
        * anonymine.py: Primitive highscores interface for debugging purposes.
        * anonymine_engine.py: New classes: hiscores, hiscores_dummy
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine (play_game)): Create a `hiscores`
            object.
            Second return argument is now a `hiscores` object, previously
            it was a float representing the time it took to win or lose.
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine (__init__)): Added self.dimensions
            and self.flagcount to allow `play_game` to create a proper
            paramstring for hiscores.__init__.


2016-07-07      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.2.2

            - Added a sanity check.
        * configure.py: Fix verbosity setting for Makefile.

        * Makefile.static (overwrite-cfg):
            Use $(info) instead of echo.
        * Makefile.static (dist, tarballs, zip):
            Don't bother writing out the "Depends on tarballs and zip"
            message as that itself depends on those two targets.
            Messages are now printed by zip and tarballs.
    0.2.1
        * NEWS: Changes from 0.1.0 to 0.2.0

            0.0.38 didn't work on Python 2.

            appropriate exit code.
        * anonymine_fields.py:
            - Why the hell would these classes need a '__hash__' method?
            - Eliminated empty doc-strings from `hexagonal_field`.
            - Wrote the empty doc-strings for `generic_field`.
            - Wrote a main doc-string for the module.
        * anonymine_engine.py:
            Moved the first doc-string above the 'import' statements to
            prevent displaying some boring FreeBSD license as doc-string.
    0.0.35

            It is now possible to move diagonally in the von Neumann mode.

    0.0.34
        * anonymine_fields.py, anonymine_engine.py: Python 3 bugfixes:
            Forgot to wrap map() in list() causing the game to crash
            when it places the mines and of some reason integer arithmetic
            became floating point in the fields module.
    
    0.0.33
        * BUGS: BUG#4 was rejected. P(BUG#2) < 1/250250

            NetBSD causes exceptions to be raised when ^Cing the game
            on Python 3.
            Change:
                - Python 3 on NetBSD will always exit 0.
                - Python 3 on other systems that hang on exit will hang.
                - Python 2 on other systems that hang on exit will exit
                    appropriately.
                - Will exit appropriately on systems that don't hang
                    on exit.
        * configure.py: Fixed the fix for the NetBSD related bug:
            Don't raise SystemExit(1) on error, use os._exit() instead.
        * anonymine_fields.py: Renewed the `generic_field` class as
            _deref caused some confusion if used more than once.
            Performance is about the same.
        * anonymine_fields.py: Completed the doc-strings.
        * INSTALL: Added some important notes about python symlinks.

        * cursescfg (curses-output/free): Create visual difference between
            free cells and background when color is disabled.

            with Minix 3.
        * configure.py: Change $(prefix) to something appropriate.
        * INSTALL, configure.py: Implement a -w option to use the old/wrong

    0.0.29
        * Makefile.static (overwrite-cfg): Bugfix: initcfg to enginecfg.
            `grep initcfg -- ./*` confirms that this bug is finally solved.
        *: Introduced crapfile 'LICENSE'.
        * BUGS: Made a small correction to BUG#3 and added defined "since"
            as >=77818 fields.

            profiling code.

            Added a description of the coordinate system to the doc-string.

            as problematic. Learned the alphabet.
    0.0.28
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine):
            * (init_field, init_field1, init_field2):
                `init_field` now takes care of the traditional/stupid mode.
                And the method of generating guessless minefields has been
                improved.
        * anonymine_engine.py (game_engine.place_mines):
            REMOVED as it is no longer needed.

            Reconfigured to work better with init_field2.

            Makes the solver 4x as fast.
        * anonymine_solver.py, anonymine_fields.py:
            Closer inspection of the caching of neighbours gives a speed
            multiplier of 2.5.
            The solver is now approx 10x as fast as in version 0.0.23.
    0.0.25
        * anonymine_solver.py (solver.rule9bf): The bug found at 0.0.24
            might have been found.  It was checking if a free cell was a
            neighbour to EACH unsolved cell rather than to ANY unsolved
            cell.
            I will run a bugcatcher to verify that the bug that may or may
            not exist, is very improbable to occur.

        * configure.py: Try to get this to work on Python 2.5.
        * Makefile.static: Have 'check-install-cfg' as a dependency of
            'install' in the hope of that this will prevent installing
            if the pre-existing configuration files are incompatible.
        * Makefile.static: Cosmetic changes at the top comments.
        * Makefile.static: Renamed 'to-where' to 'print-destinations'.
        * Makefile.static (dist): cd into $(builddir) and use relative paths

            possible.
        * cursescfg: A_BLINK was annoying on the cursor for square fields.
        * anonymine.py (ask): Quit immediately on ^C, don't ask.
        * configure.py: Check dependencies.
        * INSTALL: Mention dependencies.

    0.0.15
        * anonymine.py, anonymine_engine.py, anonymine_fields.py, configure.py:
        * install-cfg, initcfg:
            Put an index in all '{}'s in all format strings to be compatible
            with Python 2.6.
        * anonymine.py: Allow the modules "argparse" and "traceback" to be
            missing.
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): Implemented dummy mode when argparse
            is unavailable.
    0.0.14
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.__init__): Minimal allowed resolution is
            now 10x8 for hexagonal fields.
        * anonymine.py: Gave the doc-strings a summary line. (PEP 0257)
        * install-cfg: BUGFIX: Forgot to import os.
    0.0.13
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Extended the main doc-string.
        * anonymine.py, anonymine.py (maindoc): Added a doc-string for the
            whole module, currently empty.
        * anonymine.py (ask, convert_param): Wrote the doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py (convert_params): Renamed to convert_param as it takes
            one parameter.
        * anonymine.py (convert_param):
            * Allow '4', '6', '8' and 'hexagonal' as `s` when
                paramtype == "gametype".
            * Moved the 'yesno' block to the top as it is probably the most
                usable for re-use.
            * Improved the Easter egg for paramtype=='dimension'.
    0.0.12
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Wrote the remaining doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.print_hex, curses_game.print_square):
            The area mentioned in the doc-strings accidentally included the
            bottom line (currently used for the flags left text).
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Replaced `self.coordinate` with
            `self.cursor` to remove some confusion.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.print_hex): Made the doc-string a
            raw string due to the backslashes.
        * ChangeLog (0.0.9): `convert_params` did already exist, the new thing
            was 'reverse-minecount'.
    0.0.11
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Wrote some doc-strings.
        * anonymine.py: Fixed the "printing of traceback without fucking
            up terminal".
            Previous behaviour: complain about curses.endwin() before
            initialization.

    0.0.10
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): Changed "epilog" to "description" in the
            call to `argparse.ArgumentParser` as it would be more appropriate.
        * anonymine.py (play_game, arg_input, main): Clearer handling of
            the configuration filepath parameters.
        * anonymine.py (main, play_game, user_input, arg_input):
            Created the doc-strings.
    0.0.9
        * anonymine.py (game_engine), anonymine_engine.py: Moved the
            game engine class into its own module.
        * anonymine.py (arg_input): Wrote epilog added default markers.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game): Not inherited from the game_engine class.
        * anonymine.py: Added global GAME_FILENAME to clean up some more code.
        * anonymine.py (user_input, convert_params): Added 'reverse-minecount'
            to the function `convert_params` to fix bug in `user_input`.
            The default number of mines is now the actual default (at the time
            20%) rather than the hard coded 16%.
2016-01-02      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.8
        * configure.py, Makefile.static: The modules will now be installed
            for both versions of Python.
        * Makefile.static: Added quotation to prevent disaster if someone
            puts spaces in srcdir, builddir or DESTDIR.
    0.0.7
        * anonymine_solver.py, anonymine_fields.py, anonymine.py: Wrapped each
            call to `filter` in a list, due to incompatibilities with Python 3.
            run2, run6 and run9 in test.py now works in Py3.  Further resizing
            tests should be done.  Modules only available in the default
            version of Python.
    0.0.6
        * anonymine.py (user_input), cursescfg: Provide in-game documentation
            on the key bindings.
        * Makefile.static (install):
            Moved the configuration installation lines higher up to prevent
            installing something that can't use the available configuration.
    0.0.5
        * cursescfg: Various improvements including compacting, documenting,
            notifying about potential future incompatibility and rethinking
            hexagonal steering.
    0.0.4
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.message): Bugfix: messages will now
            be split into many lines if it doesn't fit in one.
            Previous behaviour: crash.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.__init__): Limit screen sizes to a minimum
            of 7 columns and 4 rows.
        * anonymine.py (curses_game.output): Always decrease the available
            height, not only when the flags left message doesn't fit.
            Seems to fix a resizing bug that traces to curses_game.print_char.
    0.0.3
        * Makefile, Makefile.static, configure, configure.py:
            A simple configure script has been written.
            Manual modification of the Makefile no longer needed.
        * INSTALL: Updated to match the current installation procedure.
    0.0.2
        * Makefile, install-cfg: Created a small python script to prevent
            overwriting potentially modified configuration files.
            Added the rule "overwrite-cfg" to the Makefile.
        * Makefile: @ed out all lines; added echo(1)es to tell what is being
            done.
        * INSTALL: Mentioning the install-cfg script and the overwrite-cfg
            rule.
    0.0.1
        * Makefile: Avoiding the use of `install -t` as it doesn't work on
            at least FreeBSD.

2016-01-02      Oskar Skog      <https://oskog97.com/#contact>
    0.0.0
