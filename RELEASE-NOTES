0.5.7
    - No option to disable flagcount.  (Highscores will merge.)
    - Both configuration files: Settings for highscores are now required.
    - anonymine_engine.py: The hiscores_dummy class has been removed.

0.5.6
    - cursescfg has changed: Added a key cfg['curses-input']['quit']

0.5.3
    - Links in documentation may be broken as I have recently moved from
      Github to Gitlab.

0.4.11
    - cursescfg has changed: Added a section cfg['curses-mouse-input']
    (Old versions are incompatible)

0.4.10
    - cursescfg has changed: Added a key cfg['curses-input']['attention']
      (Old versions are incompatible)

0.4.9
    - cursescfg has changed, old versions are compatible even if make install
      thinks otherwise.

0.4.8
    - PyPy will be used instead of CPython if possible.
    - New Makefile/configure variable: "python" the path to the desired
      Python interpreter.
    - MODULES_OTHERVER has been removed from configure and Makefile.
    - If you have PyPy installed, you should run
        ./configure -v # DESTDIR=foo
        make  # Needs to have the same DESTDIR as `make install`.
        sudo make install
        sudo python symlinks install    # in $(builddir)
        sudo python symlinks uninstall  # in $(builddir)

0.4.5 - 0.4.7
    - Avoid 0.4.5 and 0.4.6, use 0.4.7 instead, the issues #16 and #17 were
      not fixed correctly.
        - If you already had one of them, run
            ./configure -v && make
          to fix the issues in the previous versions.
    - `make` makes Makefile, you should only have to run `./configure` once.
    - Do not send 'srcdir' and 'builddir' to `make`.
    - `make install` depends on `make all`.

0.3.8
    - Removed Windows support.
      You can find an untested Windows version at
      https://gitlab.com/oskog97/anonymine-windows

0.3.6
    - cursescfg: color pair number are calculated automatically.
      The textics tuples are now (char, foreground, background, attributes)
      instead of (pair, char, foreground, background, attributes).

0.3.1
    - Introduced losers' highscores: anonymine_engine.hiscores.__init__
      takes one optional argument now.
      Existing highscores file is usable.

0.2.32
    - cursescfg contains a new key "highscores".
    - Function `highscores_display` in "anonymine.py" now takes different
      arguments.

0.2.24
    - Deprecated functions have been removed from the solver algorithm.

0.2.23
    - ./configure freedesktop= macosx= and windows= now take "true" or "false"
      (CASE SENSITIVE) as value.
