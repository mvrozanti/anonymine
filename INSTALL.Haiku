I haven't yet figured out how to get it installed on Haiku, but it plays
acceptably well.

On Haiku nighlty hrev < 50662, the screen may look like gibberish.  Use
TERM=vt100 on Haiku versions older than 50662.

(Tested on Haiku nightly build hrev50483 and hrev50700.)

To "install" it
> git clone https://gitlab.com/oskog97/anonymine
> cd anonymine
> touch highscores
> ./mkenginecfg python ./ ./ highscores

To play it
> cd anonymine
> python anonymine.py -c cursescfg -e enginecfg.out
