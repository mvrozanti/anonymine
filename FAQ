How can the game always be possible to win?
    It contains an algorithm that will try to solve the game before you see
    the field.  If the field can't be solved, a new will be randomized, and
    if it can be solved, the algorithm will tell the game where to place the
    mines.

What are the losers' highscores?
    Normally you'd have to actually win a game to get on the highscores,
    but not Anonymine: I,f you come close to winning but fail, you'll
    get on a highscores table designated for the losers who can't win
    an unlosable game.
    Both the count of mines left and the time are factors for the rankings.

Can I change the colors?
    Yes, the configuration file /etc/anonymine/cursescfg defines the key
    bindings and colors.  If the in-file documentation is not sufficient,
    you can ask me a follow up to the question.

How does the algorithm work with the different games?
    The solver operates on a network of cells connected to all of their
    neighbours.  It has no clue of the visual representation.

Can it play a real game for the user?
    No, but yes in theory.  There might be a few demo functions in 'test.py'.
    (Notice: They are not curses based!)
